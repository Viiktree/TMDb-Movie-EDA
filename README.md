# TMDb Movie Data Exploration
## by Okechukwu Victory


## Dataset

This dataset contains information about movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) containing columns like popularity ratings, budget, revenue, Title, cast, movie director, overview, runtime, genre, production companies, release date, release year. it also contains two columns, budget_adj and revenue_adj showing the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.


## Summary of Findings

From my exploratory data analysis of the TMDb movie dataset, the following conclusions where gotten;

* The warrior's way is the most expensive budgeted movie recorded as of 2015
* The latest year which is the year 2015, had the highest average ratings, this could mean that 2015 had the best movies leading to the highest average ratings, it could also imply that rating systems had increased overtime, leading more people to be involved in the rating sytems, further analysis would be needed to conclude.
* Contray to popular belief, the average money spent for budgets of movies yearly in recent times has actually been declining, this could be due to improvement in technology or other factors, further analysis would be needed to conclude.
* From my analysis, there seems to be no correlation between expensive budgets and popularity ratings. We would expect that expensive movies, tend to be better movies because of attention to details, thereby having higher ratings, futher analysis would be needed to conclude.
